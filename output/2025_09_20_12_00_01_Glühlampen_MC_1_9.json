  "loesungsweg": "To analyze the problem and deduce the correct statements, we consider the following simplifications:\n1. Each battery has identical emf \\( E \\) and internal resistance considered negligible for simplification.\n2. Each bulb has a fixed resistance \\( R \\) and operates at a power equal to \\( P = \\frac{E^2}{R} \\) when connected to one battery.\nNow, let us evaluate each statement based on the circuit connections:\n1. **A)** When batteries and bulbs are in series, the total voltage from the batteries doubles (\\( 2E \\)), and total resistance quadruples (two bulbs in series, \\( 2R \\)). Current resulting is \\( I = \\frac{2E}{2R} = \\frac{E}{R} \\). Power delivered is doubled to \\( P_{total} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{E^2}{R} \\). Drain on each battery is four times quicker than single operation (time \\( t_{new} = t/4 \\)).\n2. **B)** Two batteries in series double voltage \\( 2E \\). Bulbs in parallel halve their effective resistance \\( R/2 \\). Current becomes \\( I = \\frac{2E}{R/2} = \\frac{4E}{R} \\); hence each battery's relative drain rate is \\( 2 \\cdot t/4 = t/2 \\).\n3. **C)** With parallel batteries (effective \\( E \\)) and bulbs in series (\\( 2R \\)), net current \\( I = \\frac{E}{2R} \\) halves. Power per bulb remains constant; batteries last \\( 2t \\).\n4. **D)** With all in parallel (same \\( E \\)), each bulb receives \\( P \\) as in single setup, but duration relative to a single battery remains \\( t \\).",
