  "loesungsweg": "Um diese Aufgabe zu lösen, betrachten wir zunächst die idealisierten Annahmen: Each battery provides a fixed voltage (V) until its entire energy is depleted, and the internal resistance of the batteries is negligible. Also, the resistance of the bulbs (R) is constant. The power delivered to a bulb (P) is determined as P = V^2 / R, implying a constant energy consumption rate. The lifetime t of a single bulb powered by one battery is proportional to the energy content of the battery, E_battery, divided by power consumption rate, i.e., t ∝ E_battery / P. Let's analyze each case separately: *Option A*: Batteries and bulbs in series double the voltage across the bulbs, quadrupling power consumption (P = 4 * (V^2)/R) due to P ∝ V^2. This reduces lifetime to t/4. **Correct**. *Option B*: Series batteries with parallel bulbs offer the same lifetime per battery as a single battery powers each bulb independently, providing t/2 lifetime. **Correct**. *Option C*: Parallel batteries and series bulbs halve the power through each bulb and double the system's energy, giving lifetime of 2t. **Correct**. *Option D*: Parallel setup for batteries and bulbs keeps the power and effective energy content the same as the standard case, maintaining a lifetime t. **Correct**.",
