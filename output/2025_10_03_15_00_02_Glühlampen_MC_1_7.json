  "loesungsweg": "To determine the correct statements, let's analyze the scenarios considering the electrical characteristics of resistive elements and batteries. Assumptions include: the batteries are ideal, providing a constant voltage until drained, and each bulb has a constant resistance R.\\n\\n1. When two batteries are in series, the combined voltage doubles (2V). If also the two lamps are in series, the equivalent load resistance is 2R. The current through the circuit is 2V/(2R) = V/R, so each lamp receives half this current, leading to identical light duration as one battery powering one lamp; thus, the runtime remains t per lamp, contradicting A.\\n\\n2. If the two batteries are in series and the lamps are parallel, the total equivalent loading resistance halves (R/2), leading to doubling current draw (2 × V/R), meaning the batteries will drain in t/2 duration. Thus, statement B is correct.\\n\\n3. If the batteries are parallel, the voltage stays the same (V), but the capacity doubles—theoretically extending runtime to 2t. For lamps in series, they still draw current limited by 2R, maintaining twice the runtime, confirming statement C.\\n\\n4. Where batteries and bulbs are both parallel, the resistance stays R, and the batteries support standard current, lasting a combined single runtime of t. Thus, D is correct.",
