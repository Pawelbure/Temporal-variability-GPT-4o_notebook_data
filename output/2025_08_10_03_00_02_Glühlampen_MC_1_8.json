  "loesungsweg": "To approach this problem, we assume ideal components where batteries exhibit consistent voltage up until they deplete entirely, and their energy storage can be represented by constant capacity. Similarly, the resistance of the incandescent lamps remains constant irrespective of potential voltage changes. Let's analyze each configuration:\n\nA) When the batteries and lamps are in series, the voltage of the circuit is doubled, but the current flowing decreases owing to doubled resistance. This configuration results in energy depletion faster despite lower current since power is proportional to the square of the total current (P = V²/R). Hence, the operating time reduces notably.\n\nB) Batteries in series and lamps in parallel cause total voltage to double and equal energy distribution between parallel circuits, halving respective resistance. Thus, the total power supplied effectively halves the operational time compared to a single unit.\n\nC) With parallel batteries and series lamps, each lamp experiences diminished current collectively extending circuit operational time as energy resources double, extending illumination duration to 2t.\n\nD) Parallel connections for both batteries and lamps balance power utilization and circuit stability. Each lamp meets original operational duration t owing to shared energy equivalency.",
