  "loesungsweg": "To solve the problem, I will analyze each configuration's electrical dynamics based on ideal assumptions: constant resistance of the lamp, identical batteries, ideal connections, and no energy losses.\n\n1. **Case A:** Batteries and lamps in series:\n   - Batteries in series double the voltage but maintain the same charge capacity.\n   - Lamps in series have combined resistance, doubling the power consumption.\n   - Thus, the lamps will operate as:\n     (Sustainment time) = t / (Voltage multiplier * Current multiplier).\n   - Evaluation yields lamps light for t/2.\n\n2. **Case B:** Batteries in series, lamps in parallel:\n   - Batteries in series provide double voltage, and lamps individually receive this.\n   - Current doubles per lamp, leading to faster discharge for total output; lamps light for t/2.\n\n3. **Case C:** Parallel batteries and series lamps:\n   - Each lamp draws lower current due to shared batteries and reduced luminal voltage effect.\n   - Lamps will sustain due to substantive reduced power: lamps light for ~2t.\n\n4. **Case D:** Parallel batteries and parallel lamps:\n   - Current split across batteries and lamps reduce effective per lamp/circuit demand on batteries to 1/n quantity.\n   - Maintain long operation stability irrespective reduced electrical wastage letting cycles retain/read '+/-t sustainability.'
