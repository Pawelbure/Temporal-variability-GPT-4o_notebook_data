  "loesungsweg": "**Relevant assumptions:**\\n1. The internal resistance of the batteries is neglected, and each battery provides a constant voltage until depleted.\\n2. The resistance of the bulbs is constant and does not vary with voltage or temperature.\\n3. Energy supplied by the battery is constant and only depends on its voltage and capacity.\\n\\n**Solution Process:**\\nCase analyses for the given setups:\\n\\n**Option A:** Batteries in series, Lamps in series:\\n- Batteries in series double the voltage provided to the circuit.\\n- Lamps in series double the resistance. Hence, the current remains constant (I = V/R).\\n- Total power remains constant, and energy expenditure rate matches the single-lamp scenario.\\n- This setup provides the same time (t).\\n\\n**Option B:** Batteries in series, Lamps in parallel:\\n- Series batteries double the voltage.\\n- Parallel lamps halve the effective resistance.\\n- Current quadruples, power increases fourfold, and time reduces to t/4.\\n\\n**Option C:** Batteries in parallel, Lamps in series:\\n- Parallel batteries maintain the same voltage. Energy capacity doubles.\\n- Lamps in series double resistance and current halving.\\n- Reduced power doubles operational time (2t).\\n\\n**Option D:** Batteries and Lamps in parallel:\\n- Parallel configuration maintains the same voltage and halved effective resistance in bulb circuit.\\n- Energy doubles, and time matches single setup (t).\\n\\n**Correct Options:** C, D",
